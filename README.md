# ebay_product_listings
Collection of data for over 1000 listings of a product category to analyze and infer differences between Sponsored and Non-Sponsored listings

This was a class project for the course "Data Design and Representation". 

The objective was to scrape the details for all product listings of "iPhone 11 pro" and analyse the Sponsored listings vs Non-Sponsored ones

This notebook also contains a statistical summary analysis of these products along with specific insights about Sponsored vs Non-Sponsored listings
